    Title: "How I got into coding?",

    sub_title: "About my journey to web development.",
    paragraph: [
      "I was in Grade 4 when I was first introduced to the subject of Computer Science. It was also the first time I got to use a computer, and I still remember how amazed I was just looking at it made me go, “Waauuu.” As time passed, in Grade 6, we were introduced to QBASIC, and that was when I got my first exposure to coding. Even writing simple commands like printf() and scanf() fascinated me. That moment sparked my interest in programming.",
      "In Grade 8, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our classes were held online. That year, I got introduced to HTML and web development, which drew me in even more. Learning simple HTML and CSS, creating basic tables, and writing my first “Hello World!” excited me so much that I ran to my mom in the middle of class just to show her what I had created. That was the first time I seriously considered pursuing a career in the IT field, although I wasn’t yet familiar with all its branches. Then in Grade 9, I got to learn C programming my first real programming language and I was incredibly excited. I stayed one step ahead of my friends in coding, and my computer teacher would often praise me and even send me to help others who were struggling. I was so passionate about it that I used to write #include<stdio.h> and #include<conio.h> on my hands and walk around like I owned it.",
      "In Grade 11, we returned to basics C programming and HTML and by then, I felt so confident that I thought I was the champ of the class. I even thought I knew more than the teacher himself (lol), but reality hit when I realized I had forgotten quite a bit (lol). Still, among my classmates, I remained the strongest in coding. That was when I knew for sure which field I wanted to pursue: web development. To sharpen my skills, I took an online course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the ‘Apna College’ YouTube channel. I truly believe it’s one of the best for beginners, and Shradha Didi explains everything clearly, with relatable examples and simple words.",
      " After completing the course, I built my first Rock, Paper, Scissors game using basic HTML, CSS, and JS. I also started cloning websites, and one of my proudest moments was successfully cloning Google’s landing page. That’s how my journey began. As for where I am now, I’ve completed a MERN Stack Development course and am currently working on developing my skills further. As a MERN stack developer, I’ve built an expense tracker, a to-do list app, a calculator, and even a portfolio site for a friend. Currently, I’m working on building a real-time chatting app.",

    sub_title: "Important notes related to HTML, Everything related to tags.",
    paragraph: [
      `HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a standard markup language that is used for creating web pages or say used in web development. It is the backbone of the web development and to clear things out it is not a programming language.
Talking about the tags in HTML, they are the building blocks to structure and format contents of a web page. There are mainly two types of tags, and they are paired (container) tags and unpaired (self-closing) tags. Paired tags as it’s name states are the tags with it’s pair (example, <p>…</p>, <div>…</div>,etc). Where as unpaired tags are those tags which do not have any pair (example, <hr/>, <br/>, etc), these tags are also known as self-closing tags. 
Based on their functioning tags can be categorised into different types. such as basic HTML tags, Formatting tags, List tags, Table tags and Media tags.`,

    paragraph: [
      "My journey as an admission counscelour started from 29 june, 2025. This was my very first day as an admission counscelour. Before diving deep into this let's talk about how I got into this.",
      "So, this is about one fine day, (Note:- I don't know the exact date :(, I'm very poor at remembering dates) when one of our program co-ordinator Mr.Prajwal Shrestha sir had called me. But at that time i was taking a shower so I couldn't pick it up at that time. After I came out of the shower, when I checked my phone I shaw a call from Global College of Management (A.K.A GCM). When I first shaw the call from college, I was so confused and nervous. I was so nervour that, I started to remember all the days that I've spent in the college. I was wondering what wrong I did that college is calling me.",
      "Then, I gathered some courage and called back. Prajwal sir picked the call and asked me to come over to college. Waauuuu my nervousness increased even more. Now I started to remember, each and every kandas* that I've done in the college ( though I've never done ). I started creating each and every possible reason to call me. I though of submitting incomplete homeworks, entering into tha classroom withouth the signature of program co-ordinator in the class permission slip. I thought of every possible reaon but my mind never thought of admission counscelling* for which he had called.",
      "I reached to college and there I found my old classmate Saundarya Bhatta, whom he also had called. Then, I asked why were we been called then she replied 'I don't know.'. Shit are we dead or something. So, after gathering some courage we both took our steps towards program co-ordinator's room. We went inside he room but found noone inside. Then we asked about Prajwal sir with our Jiban dai and he replied that he has go to have a lunch so we also went down to our canteen. Luckily we found him there just finishing his lunch. We met him and then we all went up inside the program co-ordinator's room. Till that time also I was so scared and was unaware that we were called to ask about our interest in becoming an admission counscelour.",
      "After entering into the room and sitting on the sofa, he went silent for a while and was looking for something in this monitor then he started to talk about admission counscelign. Only then I got soo realef. After hearing about admission counsceling I ",
